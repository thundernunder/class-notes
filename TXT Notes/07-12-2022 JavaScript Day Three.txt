Git Branching
- useful if multiple people are working within repository 
- can create additional branches so you can make changes to the files in your local environment without affecting the main branch 
- create a branch
	- git branch <NAME OF BRANCH>
		-example git branch feature/awesomeFeature
	- git checkout feature/awesomeFeature
	- you are now in the branch you created (shortcut to go directly 		into branch you created is git checkout -b 	"feature/awesomeFeature" 
	- all your changes in the created branch will ONLY be reflected on 	your branch, main is untouched. 
	- use MERGE to reflect changes from created branch on main branch			- git checkout main
		- git merge <NAME OF BRANCH>, and changes of branch are 			reflected on main branch
		- git push to update online repository

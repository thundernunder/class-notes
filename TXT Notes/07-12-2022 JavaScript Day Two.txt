Array 
- store multiple variables 
- denotes with []
	- example: var names = ["Nate", "Kristen", "Henry", "Emily", 				"Lucy"]

For Loop
- execute code multiple times 
	-"variable = VALUE; run through this condition if true; do 	this"
	- syntax: for (var = VALUE; conditional statement; iterator
	- for (var = i; i > 5; i++) {
		console.log(`This is the current value of i: 			${i}.`);
